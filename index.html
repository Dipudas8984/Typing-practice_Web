He didn't look like an English bully at all though. He looked like a pitbull, at the height of pitbull fear in the 90's. Like many Bulldogs, he was fascinated by wheels. He loved to attack skateboard wheels, big wheels, etc. One of his favorite things was when the UPS truck would stop on our street. It got to the point that he would hear it coming and wait at the window. He got out once and chased one, but we caught him before he caught the truck. For 10 years, the UPS truck was his love and his nemesis. Anyway... We were on a family vacation and had to cut it short because he got very sick while at the kennel. We took him to his vet and learned that he had a very aggressive form of lung cancer (he had no symptoms until he was at the kennel. Had just been to the vet a few months prior). We had to euthanize him that day. He was that bad off. It was truly one of the most unexpected depressing events of my life. I took him outside for his final walk. Right across from the vet's office was a Wendy's (fast food restaurant). As I was walking him, and crying over how frail and sick he seemed, a UPS truck pulled right up to us. The driver jumped out to grab his lunch. Well...you know how they leave the doors open on those trucks? He perked up. He looked at the truck. He looked at me. I said 'Ok, go for it' and as weak as he was, he pulled me over to the truck.</h4>
